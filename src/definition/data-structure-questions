Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data structures are used in computing to make it easy to locate and retrieve information.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures? Traversing, Searching, Inserting,
    Deleting, Sorting, Merging.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively? Compiler Design, Operating System,
    Database Management System, Statistical Analysis Package, Numerical Analysis, Graphics.
what is an Array? An Array is a dynamically-created object that serves as a container to hold constant number of values
    of the same type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList? Arrays are static in nature. Arrays are fixed length data
    structures. ArrayList is dynamic in nature.
what is LinkedList? Linkedlist uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
How is an Array different from Linked List? ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data. LinkedList is better
    for manipulation data.
what is queue? A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end
    called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.
what is stack? Stack is an ordered list in which, insertion and deletion can be performed only at one end that is called
    top.
what is FIFO and LIFO? First In First Out, Last In First Out.
what is the order of complexity? It is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm
    finishes between two factors of it. Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying
    algorithm, the faster it will run and the better it will scale.
what is the best case to search an element from an array? Binary Search
what is the worst case to search an element from an array? Hypothetical data set.
what is tree in data structure? A Tree is a recursive data structure containing the set of one or more data nodes is
    designated as the root of the tree while the remaining nodes are called as the children of the root.
what is graph in data structure? A graph can be defined as a group of vertices and edges that are used to connect
    these vertices. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship
    among them instead of having parent child relationship.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap? HashTable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared
    with many threads. HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads
    without proper synchronization code.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
    RDBMS uses Array. Network data model uses Graphs and Hierarchical data model uses Trees.
How HashMap works in java? HashMap works on the principal of hashing. HashMap stores both key and value object, in bucket,
    as an object of Entry class which implements HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get(key) method
    for retrieving values from HashMap.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs? ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime Exception
    thrown only at runtime. It occurs when Java program tries to access an invalid part of the program.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array? Arrays inherit methods from Object class, and clone
    it one of them Object.clone() Arrays.copyOf() Arrays.copyOfRange() System.arraycopy()
What is difference between an array and a linked list? In array, each element is independent, no connection with
    previous element or with its location. In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part
    of previous element/node.
What is DFS and BFS? Depth First Search: DFS is a method for exploring a tree or graph. Breadth First Search: BFS is a
    method for exploring a tree or graph.
What is Recursion? Recursion in Java is a process in which a method calls itself continously.
What are linear and non linear data Structures? Linear data structures are Array, Stack, Queue and LinkedList.
    Non Linear data structures are trees and graphs.
What is Big-(O)-notation? Big-(O)-notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It
    specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space
    used by an algorithm
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity? Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, Heapsort,
    Quicksort, Bubble sort, Shellsort, Comb sort.

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
